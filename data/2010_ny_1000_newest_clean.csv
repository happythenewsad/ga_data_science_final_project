Anne has no immediate survivors. She does leave, however, her good friend, Father Daniel Morrissey, and a host of others enriched by their relationship with this extraordinary woman. Anne was born in Paris in 1928, the only child of Annabella, an international film star. In 1939 Annabella married the American actor, Tyrone Power, who adopted Anne. She always spoke fondly of Power, and he of her. On April 5, 1941, Tyrone wrote in his journal, ""Today is Anni's birthday. I told Anni there was another present out front. She didn't say a word, just went over and touched the horse. After hugging the breath out of me, she kept whispering over and over again, â€˜My horse, my dear little horse."" Anne grew up in the Hollywood of the 1940s, a dazzling time. Yet in her telling of it Anne was not dazzled. The simple joys of daily family life remained most vivid to her. Her parents entertained some of the most beautiful and celebrated people in the world, and from her upstairs room she could watch the arriving guests, the Clark Gables, the Gary Coopers, the Henry Fondas, Judy Garland. To Anne they were not celebrities, and certainly not icons, but rather friends of the family from down the street. From childhood Anne spoke French and English. In her twenties she became fluent in German. Throughout her life she read broadly in those languages, deepening her love of history. Her experience as a world traveler made her an informed conversationalist. She was thoughtful, articulate, an eager listener, who genuinely wanted to know what others had to say. Anne exercised horses at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. She also taught actors to ride, and while on the set of Decision Before Dawn, she met Oskar Werner, a prominent actor in European classical theater and film. After they married in 1954, they travelled throughout the world as Oskar became an international film star, but they lived in Liechtenstein. Anne was always very grateful that she was able to come to know the great literature of the German language and the music and opera of Werner's native Austria. Their marriage ended in 1968. Anne returned to the United States, settling in North Hampton, a small New Hampshire seaside town. She put down roots which deepened over time, taking a position as an aide teaching deaf children to speak, a job she held for nearly twenty years. After retiring she continued to work as a volunteer at the North Hampton Library. In 1998 Anne designed and built a home filled with light and welcoming to guests. She lived only a mile from the ocean, which she loved in all its moods, and could walk to it almost every day. Anne kept close ties to France and returned each summer to Annabella's sheep farm, Contramundo, in the foothills of the Pyrenees, outside St Jean de Luz. There in the Basque countryside Anne welcomed many American friends together with Romanov emigres, writers, politicians and artists who visited her mother. For each guest Anne made the beauty and vitality of Contramundo a unique and unforgettable memory. Tolstoy writes in War and Peace, which Anne reread many times, ""Love hinders death. Love is life. Everything, everything I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is connected only by that.""

Deeply loved by her family and cherished by her many friends around the world, she is survived by her husband of seventeen years, Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr.; and by her nieces, Ellen Iseman and Beverly Ross, and four nephews, Peter Iseman, Fred Iseman, Alfred Ross, and Clifford Ross. She is also survived by two stepdaughters, Lise Motherwell and Jeannie Motherwell, from her first marriage, to the artist Robert Motherwell, and by two stepchildren, Jennifer DuBrul and Nicholas DuBrul, as well as three grandnephews, two grandnieces, four step-granddaughters, two step-great-grandsons, and one step-great-granddaughter. Helen Frankenthaler was born in Manhattan in 1928, the third daughter of New York State Supreme Court Judge Alfred Frankenthaler and Martha Lowenstein Frankenthaler. Her sisters, Marjorie Frankenthaler Iseman and Gloria Frankenthaler Ross Bookman, predeceased her. Helen Frankenthaler graduated from The Dalton School, having attended The Brearley School and The Horace Mann School. A 1949 graduate of Bennington College, she served as a member of the College's Board of Trustees from 1967 to 1982. She was the recipient of twenty-six honorary degrees, as well as other notable honors, including the National Medal of the Arts, in 2001. Most recently, she was appointed as an Honorary Academician of the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 2011. From 1985 to 1992, she was a member of the National Council on the Arts, part of the National Endowment for the Arts. A perfectionist and planner to the end, she made clear her wish to be buried at her alma mater, Bennington College, in Vermont, where a private ceremony will be held. A memorial service in New York City will be announced in the weeks ahead. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her memory to Bennington College or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City. Helen was a family treasure, a national treasure, and will be forever missed by those who knew her well and by a public who admired her vibrant works of art. In her career she was an original, brilliant, energetic, witty presence who shone brightly in our firmament. With her passing, her world and her family are left with a deep void and diminished color.",,24,[],The New York Times,[],"Paid Notice: Deaths  FRANKENTHALER, HELEN","[{""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""FRANKENTHALER, HELEN""}]",2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,article,Classified,Paid Death Notices,,,Paid Death Notice,4fd2b9fc8eb7c8105d8b0693,396

That exhibit is complemented by an HBO documentary telling the story of the Lovings' struggle to return home after living in exile in Washington, where Mildred, gentle in person but persistent on paper, wrote pleading letters to Robert F. Kennedy and the A.C.L.U. Two lawyers took their case to the Supreme Court, whichstruck down miscegenation laws in more than a dozen states. The Lovings' belief in the simple rightness of their plea never wavered. Asked by one of his lawyers if he had a message for the Supreme Court, Richard said he did: ''Tell the court I love my wife.''

Deeply loved by her family and cherished by her many friends around the world, she is survived by her husband of seventeen years, Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr.; and by her nieces, Ellen Iseman and Beverly Ross, and four nephews, Peter Iseman, Fred Iseman, Alfred Ross, and Clifford Ross. She is also survived by two stepdaughters, Lise Motherwell and Jeannie Motherwell, from her first marriage, to the artist Robert Motherwell, and by two stepchildren, Jennifer DuBrul and Nicholas DuBrul, as well as three grandnephews, two grandnieces, four step-granddaughters, two step-great-grandsons, and one step-great-granddaughter. Helen Frankenthaler was born in Manhattan in 1928, the third daughter of New York State Supreme Court Judge Alfred Frankenthaler and Martha Lowenstein Frankenthaler. Her sisters, Marjorie Frankenthaler Iseman and Gloria Frankenthaler Ross Bookman, predeceased her. Helen Frankenthaler graduated from The Dalton School, having attended The Brearley School and The Horace Mann School. A 1949 graduate of Bennington College, she served as a member of the College's Board of Trustees from 1967 to 1982. She was the recipient of twenty-six honorary degrees, as well as other notable honors, including the National Medal of the Arts, in 2001. Most recently, she was appointed as an Honorary Academician of the Royal Academy of Arts, London in 2011. From 1985 to 1992, she was a member of the National Council on the Arts, part of the National Endowment for the Arts. A perfectionist and planner to the end, she made clear her wish to be buried at her alma mater, Bennington College, in Vermont, where a private ceremony will be held. A memorial service in New York City will be announced in the weeks ahead. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in her memory to Bennington College or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York City. Helen was a family treasure, a national treasure, and will be forever missed by those who knew her well and by a public who admired her vibrant works of art.

Anne has no immediate survivors. She does leave, however, her good friend, Father Daniel Morrissey, and a host of others enriched by their relationship with this extraordinary woman. Anne was born in Paris in 1928, the only child of Annabella, an international film star. In 1939 Annabella married the American actor, Tyrone Power, who adopted Anne. She always spoke fondly of Power, and he of her. On April 5, 1941, Tyrone wrote in his journal, ""Today is Anni's birthday. I told Anni there was another present out front. She didn't say a word, just went over and touched the horse. After hugging the breath out of me, she kept whispering over and over again, My horse, my dear little horse."" Anne grew up in the Hollywood of the 1940s, a dazzling time. Yet in her telling of it Anne was not dazzled. The simple joys of daily family life remained most vivid to her. Her parents entertained some of the most beautiful and celebrated people in the world, and from her upstairs room she could watch the arriving guests, the Clark Gables, the Gary Coopers, the Henry Fondas, Judy Garland. To Anne they were not celebrities, and certainly not icons, but rather friends of the family from down the street. From childhood Anne spoke French and English. In her twenties she became fluent in German. Throughout her life she read broadly in those languages, deepening her love of history. Her experience as a world traveler made her an informed conversationalist. She was thoughtful, articulate, an eager listener, who genuinely wanted to know what others had to say. Anne exercised horses at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. She also taught actors to ride, and while on the set of Decision Before Dawn, she met Oskar Werner, a prominent actor in European classical theater and film. After they married in 1954, they travelled throughout the world as Oskar became an international film star, but they lived in Liechtenstein. Anne was always very grateful that she was able to come to know the great literature of the German language and the music and opera of Werner's native Austria. Their marriage ended in 1968. Anne returned to the United States, settling in North Hampton, a small New Hampshire seaside town. She put down roots which deepened over time, taking a position as an aide teaching deaf children to speak, a job she held for nearly twenty years. After retiring she continued to work as a volunteer at the North Hampton Library. In 1998 Anne designed and built a home filled with light and welcoming to guests. She lived only a mile from the ocean, which she loved in all its moods, and could walk to it almost every day. Anne kept close ties to France and returned each summer to Annabella's sheep farm, Contramundo, in the foothills of the Pyrenees, outside St Jean de Luz. There in the Basque countryside Anne welcomed many American friends together with Romanov emigres, writers, politicians and artists who visited her mother. For each guest Anne made the beauty and vitality of Contramundo a unique and unforgettable memory. Tolstoy writes in War and Peace, which Anne reread many times, ""Love hinders death. Love is life. Everything, everything I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is connected only by that.""

But it isn't until now, with the introduction of her own accessory, that she could call herself a designer. The Mini Matryoshka bag, a bucket tote in Goya leather, comes in seven Bauhaus-inspired color blocks, like canary yellow and grass green, or a Mondrian-esque red and black. There is much in the capsule that can be credited to her mother. ''She has a small-purse philosophy,'' Ms. Herrera Báez said, explaining why, for example, the bag is the compact size that it is. ''You carry only what is essential.'' But the graphic look and feel are original. ''Sometimes, great ideas on paper are just that,'' Ms. Herrera Báez said. ''The ability to fine-tune an aesthetic in tandem with intuition is a good trait for any designer to have.'' Tuck that one in your tote.

The budget slashing has already galvanized more than half of the school districts in Texas into four different lawsuits against the state, which will wind up in court next fall. In March, official numbers of how many and what types of employees were laid off by school districts will be released, just before the primaries -- the first real indicator of the budget cuts' political ramifications.

Though cloud cover the night before had scuttled my chance to see the Northern Lights, my plan for a 36-hour road trip from Reykjavik, ending a great four days in Iceland, was in full effect. I had spent the previous day's precious daylight hours (about five at this time of year) seeing the geysers, waterfalls and icy landscapes of the Golden Circle, a popular route that loops northeast from the capital of Reykjavik and back again. When the sun disappeared, at about 3 p.m., I headed southeast to the snow-covered coast, skirting imposing mountains to arrive at a guesthouse called Vellir, on Route 219 off the main highway, where I planned to spend the night.

Like anyone born to achieve, he resented the small distractions -- and the fashion business provides plenty of them. Well, even he probably never dreamed that 661,509 people would go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see his clothes. What were they expecting to see? Genius, yes; but the plain, early tailored pieces, like the bumster trousers and perfectly cut jackets, told a lot. The man knew what he was doing. Knowledge was his revolution. And whether or not he could see it, Mr. McQueen had built a durable brand. The Met show -- and the royal wedding dress designed by his successor, Sarah Burton -- was proof of that. 2 If you know anything about Ms. Burton (her skill, her objectivity, her patience), then it wasn't a surprise that Kate Middleton chose McQueen to make her gown as well as the streamlined dress worn by her sister, Pippa. Ms. Burton is a good listener, and she would have been sensitive to the bride and the overwhelming demands of the occasion. The dress distilled English tradition and needle crafts; its flawless fit and styling were communicated to a television audience of tens of millions, no small thing when the medium is cloth. So far, the Duchess of Cambridge has refused to allow herself to be pushed into the high-fashion trap. She wears clothes beautifully, from Reiss and Zara to McQueen, but the lady is no clothes horse.

Norborne was born June 5, 1922 in Bethlehem, PA, the only son of Norborne Berkeley and Dorothea Randolph Berkeley. His one sister, Dorothea Berkeley Brush, died in 1991. Mr. Berkeley was President of Chemical Bank and Chemical NY Corporation (now JPMorgan Chase) from 1973-1982. He was a Director of both the Corporation and the Bank since 1972, and had been with Chemical since 1950, serving in a variety of positions before becoming President. From January, 1982 until June, 1982 he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee, at which time he retired at the age of 60. Mr. Berkeley was a graduate of the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia (1941), Yale University, BA, (Class of 1945), where he was a member of the Senior Society, Scroll and Key. He held an LL.B. degree from the University of Virginia (1949) and completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966. In World War II, Mr. Berkeley served in Europe with the US Field Artillery, First Army V Corps, from 1943-1945 and participated in five major campaigns, including the Normandy Invasion. During his career, he served on numerous corporate, educational and charitable boards including Freeport McMoran Inc., Uniroyal Inc., Anglo Energy LTD; Tuskegee University, Episcopal High School, New Canaan Country Day School (Board President), Metropolitan Opera (Managing Director), Whitney Museum of American Art, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, LISC, (Chairman), and the Vera Institute of Justice. Mr. Berkeley was appointed by President Ford, and served two Administrations (both Republican and Democratic) on the US Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations. Mr. Berkeley was an avid and accomplished sportsman throughout his life, including baseball at Yale, squash, skiing and golf. He enjoyed playing his father's ukelele and singing old, family songs; the cultural opportunities in New York City, especially the theatre; and travel around the world. His friendships formed at Yale were very special to him throughout his life and his sense of humor, value system and compassion for his fellow man will always be remembered by his many, many friends and family. He was the very loving and adored husband of Jennifer Puchta Berkeley for twenty one years and had three children by a first marriage to Diane Gould Berkeley: Sally Berkeley Tiller, Raleigh, North Carolina; Dr. Anne Randolph Berkeley, Wilmington, North Carolina; Norborne Berkeley III, Bill New York, NY, plus three wonderful grandchildren: Gabe and Jocelyn Tiller and Carmen Berkeley. Caring nieces, nephews and cousins and, his beloved Labrador retriever, Skye, also survive him. The family kindly requests no flowers and instead, if desired, suggests donations to one's own favorite charity, in Norborne Berkeley Jr.'s memory.

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/books/review/inside-the-list.html,"Tom Clancy, whose new novel hits the hardcover fiction list at No. 2 this week, is often described as prescient. But is he really?","THE USUAL SUSPECTS: Tom Clancy's fans like to describe his macho geek-boy thrillers as prescient, citing among other things his 1994 novel ''Debt of Honor,'' in which a deranged pilot crashes a 747 into the Capitol. On Sept. 11, 2001, Clancy himself played up the overlap on CNN, without mentioning that the book is a ludicrous alarmist fantasy about a corporate-controlled Japan making war on America. In other words, it was less prescient than derivative: ''Rising Sun,'' Michael Crichton's version of ''The Japanese are coming!'' had been a best seller two years before. In a telephone interview on ''Charlie Rose'' later on 9/11, Clancy again seemed out of the loop. As Rose's panelists talked about Osama bin Laden and the possibility of military retaliation, Clancy jumped in petulantly. ''Saying 'Osama bin Laden,' '' he insisted, ''is like Claude Rains in 'Casablanca' saying, 'Round up the usual suspects.' He's simply the usual suspect. But there has been no definitive information linking him to this event. Until there is, talking about him is just a waste of air.'' Later on the program, as the former National Security Adviser Samuel Berger tried to answer a question, Clancy's disembodied voice floated over the set. ''Why is there a car in our driveway?'' he asked, apparently forgetting he was wired for sound. ''Tom, wait till I come to you,'' Rose said.",,18,[],The New York Times,"[{""url""=>""images/2011/12/25/books/review/25clancy/25clancy-thumbStandard.jpg"", ""subtype""=>""thumbnail"", ""legacy""=>{""hasthumbnail""=>""Y"", ""thumbnailheight""=>75, ""thumbnail""=>""images/2011/12/25/books/review/25clancy/25clancy-thumbStandard.jpg""}, ""type""=>""image"", ""height""=>75}]",Inside The List,"[{""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""BOOKS AND LITERATURE""}]",2012-01-01T00:00:00Z,article,Book Review Desk,Arts; Books,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Gregory"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""COWLES""}], ""original""=>""By GREGORY COWLES""}",News,4fd2ad818eb7c8105d89b532,613

This is my last post for 2011, an eventful year in fashion, a most peculiar year that saw a feverish spread of luxury brands in places like China and Brazil, chasing new wealth, even as insiders saw the Galliano scandal as a sobering episode for an industry that tends to push its talent hard. I wonder, though, if the insider's influence hasn't waned. To be sure, people admire the genuinely talented, and we're attracted to star personalities both on the runway and in the front row. It's also true that fashion, like everything else, runs in cycles - one moment it's guilty of gluttony, the next it regrets the whole thing.

All in all, the flights cost $350. The flight attendants were looking at me as if I was nuts, because for each pair of cities, I flew back and forth with the same crew. Saturday was Houston to Dallas to Houston to Austin to Houston; and Sunday was from Dallas to Houston to Austin to Houston. Ah, the crazy things we do to retain status. But it really is worth it to board the plane first (for prime overhead space) and for upgrades (I fly probably three weeks out of every month).

Miller died on Tuesday, December 20 of cirrhosis of the liver at Stony Brook Medical Center after a five-week hospitalization. She was 78. Ms. Miller was the daughter of Sophie and Lester Cornelius. She grew up in Richmond Hill, NY and attended Jamaica High School, thereafter working variously at The Sperry Company and The Singer Company. She also worked part-time as a fashion and television model for The Harry Conover Agency and Pendleton. Later in life, she went back to school, receiving two Associate Degrees from Queens College, New York. She was predeceased in 1998 by her beloved husband of 21 years, Willie, as well as her cherished longtime companion Robert Lovett, Sr. of Hampton Bays, NY in 2008. Dorothee was always cheery and quick with a smile, generous in her hospitality, unwavering in her opinions, independent to the last, and she will be missed greatly by her family and many friends. Ms. Miller is survived by her sister and brother-in-law, Joan and Richard Gibbs of Oak Creek, CO, her son and daughter-in-law, Todd and Lenore Evans of Remsenburg, NY, her son and daughter-in-law, Scott and Cynthia Evans of Chestertown, NY, and her grandchildren Alyssa, Cole, Casey, Kristin, Cody, and Jessie. According to Ms. Miller's wishes, there will be no funeral or memorial services. Her cremains will be scattered across Long Island Sound by her family.

The Board of Trustees and the Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art mourn the loss of Helen Frankenthaler. Her searing intellect and fearless innovations launched a new direction for postwar painting. By experimenting with the qualities of paint and canvas, she was able to create, in her own words, ""explosive landscapes, worlds and distances, held on a flat surface."" Frankenthaler's work was first shown at the Whitney in 1955 and has subsequently been included in over 40 exhibitions at the Museum. A mid-career retrospective of her work was organized by the Whitney in 1969. The Museum is also proud to hold close to a dozen works in our permanent collection; the first of which, Blue Territory, was acquired from the 1955 Annual. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband, Stephen M. DuBrul Jr., and her stepdaughters, Jeannie and Lise Motherwell. Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman Leonard A.

Norborne was born June 5, 1922 in Bethlehem, PA, the only son of Norborne Berkeley and Dorothea Randolph Berkeley. His one sister, Dorothea Berkeley Brush, died in 1991. Mr. Berkeley was President of Chemical Bank and Chemical NY Corporation (now JPMorgan Chase) from 1973-1982. He was a Director of both the Corporation and the Bank since 1972, and had been with Chemical since 1950, serving in a variety of positions before becoming President. From January, 1982 until June, 1982 he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee, at which time he retired at the age of 60. Mr. Berkeley was a graduate of the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia (1941), Yale University, BA, (Class of 1945), where he was a member of the Senior Society, Scroll and Key. He held an LL.B. degree from the University of Virginia (1949) and completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966. In World War II, Mr. Berkeley served in Europe with the US Field Artillery, First Army V Corps, from 1943-1945 and participated in five major campaigns, including the Normandy Invasion. During his career, he served on numerous corporate, educational and charitable boards including Freeport McMoran Inc., Uniroyal Inc., Anglo Energy LTD; Tuskegee University, Episcopal High School, New Canaan Country Day School (Board President), Metropolitan Opera (Managing Director), Whitney Museum of American Art, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, â€œLISCâ€, (Chairman), and the Vera Institute of Justice. Mr. Berkeley was appointed by President Ford, and served two Administrations (both Republican and Democratic) on the US Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations. Mr. Berkeley was an avid and accomplished sportsman throughout his life, including baseball at Yale, squash, skiing and golf. He enjoyed playing his father's ukelele and singing old, family songs; the cultural opportunities in New York City, especially the theatre; and travel around the world. His friendships formed at Yale were very special to him throughout his life and his sense of humor, value system and compassion for his fellow man will always be remembered by his many, many friends and family. He was the very loving and adored husband of Jennifer Puchta Berkeley for twenty one years and had three children by a first marriage to Diane Gould Berkeley: Sally Berkeley Tiller, Raleigh, North Carolina; Dr. Anne Randolph Berkeley, Wilmington, North Carolina; Norborne Berkeley III, â€œBillâ€ New York, NY, plus three wonderful grandchildren: Gabe and Jocelyn Tiller and Carmen Berkeley. Caring nieces, nephews and cousins and, his beloved Labrador retriever, Skye, also survive him. The family kindly requests no flowers and instead, if desired, suggests donations to one's own favorite charity, in Norborne Berkeley Jr.'s memory. A celebration of his life will be held at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, 18 James Lane, East Hampton, NY at 11:00am, on Saturday, January 21st, 2012.<br><br>

The Board of Trustees and the Staff of the Whitney Museum of American Art mourn the loss of Helen Frankenthaler. Her searing intellect and fearless innovations launched a new direction for postwar painting. By experimenting with the qualities of paint and canvas, she was able to create, in her own words, ""explosive landscapes, worlds and distances, held on a flat surface."" Frankenthaler's work was first shown at the Whitney in 1955 and has subsequently been included in over 40 exhibitions at the Museum. A mid-career retrospective of her work was organized by the Whitney in 1969. The Museum is also proud to hold close to a dozen works in our permanent collection; the first of which, Blue Territory, was acquired from the 1955 Annual. We extend our deepest sympathy to her husband, Stephen M. DuBrul Jr., and her stepdaughters, Jeannie and Lise Motherwell. Flora Miller Biddle, Honorary Chairman Leonard A.

''The art market is a place for new people these days,'' Christophe Van de Weghe, a New York dealer, was quoted as saying.

Joseph C. Daniels, president of the Sept. 11 foundation, added that Patricia E. Harris, the first deputy mayor, would serve as an ex-officio member representing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Naming a board was a prerequisite for tapping into $100 million that the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had set aside for the center, which is to be designed by Frank Gehry. Even though the deadline was the end of this year, the naming of the board members, like other issues related to the World Trade Center site, including financing for the Sept. 11 museum, had been held up by tension between Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.

Norborne was born June 5, 1922 in Bethlehem, PA, the only son of Norborne Berkeley and Dorothea Randolph Berkeley. His one sister, Dorothea Berkeley Brush, died in 1991. Mr. Berkeley was President of Chemical Bank and Chemical NY Corporation (now JPMorgan Chase) from 1973-1982. He was a Director of both the Corporation and the Bank since 1972, and had been with Chemical since 1950, serving in a variety of positions before becoming President. From January, 1982 until June, 1982 he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee, at which time he retired at the age of 60. Mr. Berkeley was a graduate of the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia (1941), Yale University, BA, (Class of 1945), where he was a member of the Senior Society, Scroll and Key. He held an LL.B. degree from the University of Virginia (1949) and completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1966. In World War II, Mr. Berkeley served in Europe with the US Field Artillery, First Army V Corps, from 1943-1945 and participated in five major campaigns, including the Normandy Invasion. During his career, he served on numerous corporate, educational and charitable boards including Freeport McMoran Inc., Uniroyal Inc., Anglo Energy LTD; Tuskegee University, Episcopal High School, New Canaan Country Day School (Board President), Metropolitan Opera (Managing Director), Whitney Museum of American Art, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, LISC, (Chairman), and the Vera Institute of Justice. Mr. Berkeley was appointed by President Ford, and served two Administrations (both Republican and Democratic) on the US Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations. Mr. Berkeley was an avid and accomplished sportsman throughout his life, including baseball at Yale, squash, skiing and golf. He enjoyed playing his father's ukelele and singing old, family songs; the cultural opportunities in New York City, especially the theatre; and travel around the world. His friendships formed at Yale were very special to him throughout his life and his sense of humor, value system and compassion for his fellow man will always be remembered by his many, many friends and family. He was the very loving and adored husband of Jennifer Puchta Berkeley for twenty one years and had three children by a first marriage to Diane Gould Berkeley: Sally Berkeley Tiller, Raleigh, North Carolina; Dr. Anne Randolph Berkeley, Wilmington, North Carolina; Norborne Berkeley III, Bill New York, NY, plus three wonderful grandchildren: Gabe and Jocelyn Tiller and Carmen Berkeley. Caring nieces, nephews and cousins and, his beloved Labrador retriever, Skye, also survive him. The family kindly requests no flowers and instead, if desired, suggests donations to one's own favorite charity, in Norborne Berkeley Jr.'s memory. A celebration of his life will be held at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, 18 James Lane, East Hampton, NY at 11:00am, on Saturday, January 21st, 2012.",,7,[],The New York Times,[],"Paid Notice: Deaths  BERKELEY, NORBORNE, JR.","[{""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""BERKELEY, NORBORNE, JR.""}]",2011-12-31T00:00:00Z,article,Classified,Paid Death Notices,,,Paid Death Notice,4fd2b9fb8eb7c8105d8b0630,504

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/opinion/chinas-shaky-economic-foundation.html,China's rise to economic superpower status is built upon an unresolved land struggle with hundreds of millions of lives in the balance.,"Two weeks ago peasants in Wukan, a fishing village in the prosperous southern Chinese province of Guangdong, took over their village, throwing out local leaders. Because of long unanswered grievances, they risked their lives, barricading roads into the village and facing down the police.

I braised chunks of lamb shoulder in wine, gave the dish an edge with lemon zest and white turnips, and added buttery white beans, a classic partner for lamb. If you like canned beans, rinse and drain them, and add in place of the cooked beans, with the turnips, during final simmering.
