The mission's responsibilities include strengthening governance, combating corruption, monitoring and protecting human rights and assuring fair and independently supervised elections. The current representative, Kai Eide, has been a disappointment. He has been too quiet about President Hamid Karzai's corrupt associates and too tolerant of the lax accounting practices at United Nations development programs. He was too slow, even slower than Washington, to condemn Mr. Karzai's blatant rigging of the August presidential election. Mr. Eide has announced that he will be leaving soon. Choosing the right successor is vitally important. Securing and rebuilding Afghanistan is an international, not just an American, responsibility.

A 2-7 record in 1963 hardly quieted such talk, and in its aftermath, 40-year-old Ara Parseghian was hired away from Northwestern. The fiery coach with the coal-black eyes oversaw a transformation that's still regarded as a miracle at a place where belief in them never wavers. Parseghian took the '64 Fighting Irish on a 9-1 joy ride that ended just seconds short of a national championship. The de-emphasis talk became an inaudible whisper.

86,"After a report that the Weinstein Company was scaling back its release of ''Nine,'' the studio says it has no plans to pull the movie out of some theaters, Reuters reported. Last weekend the Federico Fellini-inspired musical with a star-studded cast was showing on 1,412 screens in the United States. This week David Glasser, an operations executive for the Weinstein Company, said it was performing well on 890 screens, and Reuters reported that it would be shown on about 800 to 900 screens in the weeks ahead. On Wednesday Mr. Glasser said, ''At this moment in time there has been no plan between us nor the theater chains that we deal with to cut any theaters.'' ''Nine'' opened in limited release on Dec. 18 in the United States and expanded to wide release on Dec. 25.

It's a snapshot of Louis Armstrong in his dressing room at the Paramount Theater, in May 1937. He's in a thin black skullcap, sleeves rolled back, gnawing on a rib bone. He's holding what appears to be a goblet of beer. The look on his face is wary, distancing, maybe a little admonitory. He looks like a guy who'd rather be enjoying his meal in peace. The image bears some relevance to ''Struttin' With Some Barbecue,'' a New Year's booking at the Jazz Standard. Named after one of the immortal sides made by Armstrong's Hot Five -- ''the Old Testament of classic jazz,'' as Terry Teachout rightly observes in ''Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong,'' his scrupulous new biography -- the engagement features two proud sons of New Orleans, the pianist Henry Butler and the alto saxophonist Donald Harrison.

The issue was that the guards, as government contractors, were obligated to give an immediate report of what they had done, but the Constitution prevents the government from requiring a defendant to testify against himself, so those statements could not be used in a prosecution.",U.S. Lawyers Long Knew About Legal Pitfalls in Case Against Blackwater Guards,0

355,"Singapore's economy is improving after a volatile year in which it shrank for the first time since 2001, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, left, says. Gross domestic product fell 2.1 percent in 2009, Mr. Lee said in his New Year message on Thursday. The figure was in line with the government estimate for a contraction of 2 to 2.5 percent. The trade ministry forecasts that the economy will expand 3 to 5 percent in 2010, an estimate reiterated by Mr. Lee. Singapore joined other Asian nations in emerging from a global economic slump last year after the region's governments unveiled about $1 trillion in stimulus measures to spur growth. Still, a sluggish recovery in overseas demand for goods could moderate growth prospects in the coming months, the government said in November. The economy grew 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Mr. Lee said. That compares with the 3.8 percent median forecast of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.",Singapore Says Its Economy Is Set To Grow This Year,0

453,"WHEN you think of Akira Kurosawa, you think, most likely, of swords and flags, of castles under siege, of men in dark armor and women in brilliant kimonos, of horses galloping to battle in driving rain. The movie that brought Kurosawa -- and Japanese cinema as a whole -- to the attention of the world, ''Rashomon'' (1950), was set in the distant past, and practically all the most celebrated films of the remaining 40-plus years of his career were historical dramas, too: ''The Seven Samurai'' (1954), ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), ''Yojimbo'' (1961), ''Sanjuro'' (1962) and ''Ran'' (1985). So it might seem a little strange that Film Forum's centennial Kurosawa retrospective should begin (on Wednesday) with a nine-day run of the 1949 urban noir ''Stray Dog,'' in which there isn't a horse or a castle in sight, and where the weapon of choice is a Colt pistol. It shouldn't. Of the 30 movies Kurosawa directed, better than half tell stories of present-day Japan, and a fair number of them, including ''Stray Dog,'' rank with his greatest works. ''Stray Dog,'' his ninth film, is a kind of police-procedural thriller, in which a young Tokyo homicide detective named Murakami (Toshiro Mifune) roams the crowded streets of the postwar city in search of his stolen gun. At first he merely feels humiliated, but before long much more painful emotions take hold. He learns, to his horror, that his gun is being used to commit robberies: one woman is seriously injured; the next dies. Murakami, crazed with grief and guilt, combs the seedier quarters of the sprawling city, where everybody looks hungry and desperate, wearied by an unrelenting summer heat. He trudges through this unwelcoming terrain with the grim persistence of a soldier making his way home after a lost campaign.",Kurosawa: Past and Present Tense,0

And while DVD sales declined by some $1 billion in 2009 from the previous year, sales of Blu-ray discs, according to data from the Digital Entertainment Group, rose by $200 million, partially offsetting the industry downturn.

Whatever you call the art of the last decade, there was a ton of it. Has the world ever turned out more, in more varieties, than in the last 10 years? I doubt it. The 2000s really started in the late 1990s. In the early years of that decade the American economy was in woeful shape, the art market a shambles. AIDS and the culture wars raged.

Universal had bought a script he'd written with his brother and frequent collaborator, Daniel -- an offbeat comedy called ''Welcome to Buzzsaw'' -- and as it inched towards production, the pair landed a gig on the 1990 action film ''Darkman,'' an early hit for the director Sam Raimi. In 1992 ''Welcome to Buzzsaw'' arrived in theaters, renamed ''Out on a Limb'' and starring Matthew Broderick. ''I was incredibly lucky,'' Josh Goldin said on a recent afternoon, sitting in a downtown Manhattan hotel lounge. And then, for the next 17 years, Mr. Goldin became a ghost. He worked on projects that either never came out or made it to theaters without his name on them. ''I wrote scripts that never went anywhere,'' he said, ''and I did rewrites for projects that looked like they might go somewhere and then didn't.'' He had discovered the depressingly common side of the Hollywood life.

Murphy had 1,700 fewer plate appearances than Dawson because of injuries, but he hit 398 home runs, won Most Valuable Player awards in 1982 and 1983, and was awarded five Gold Gloves in center over 18 seasons. He is typically considered a ''close but no'' guy, his brief stretch of greatness from 1982 to '87 followed by a sharp decline.

''When we buy a house,'' said Ms. Khinda, who is engaged to Thomas O'Donnell, 32, a telecommunications worker, ''I'd like to have a very girlie room with a vanity and a very feminine chair and lots of pinks and florals.''",Don't Like the Décor?

596,"Periods of intense partisanship and turmoil occasionally lead to a smattering of Congressional party-switching. But changing affiliation is no guarantee of political survival. Just ask ex-Representative Michael P. Forbes of New York. Before the recent decision by Representative Parker Griffith of Alabama to change his Congressional jersey, Mr. Forbes had been the last House member to abandon the majority for the minority. But back in 1999, Mr. Forbes, a three-term lawmaker, went the opposite direction of Mr. Griffith, sliding from the Republican column to the smaller Democratic side, saying his party had become too narrow and intolerant.","The Time May Be Ripe for Party-Switching, but Its Risks Are Apparent",0
597,"WHEN Andrew Pattison was looking to pursue a graduate degree in sustainability, he drew on his post-college experience working as a conservation biologist in upstate New York. Butterflies were his thing, and he produced numerous recommendations about what should be done to protect them. ''I found that quote-unquote important people who were decision makers would read the reports I filed and then not follow them,'' Mr. Pattison says. Those frustrations led him in a different direction. ''I knew I wanted to study the way decisions were made on environmental policy,'' he says. He also knew where many of the important decisions were made: in cities. With energy and climate policy, he says, ''the problem is global, but all politics are local.''",Sustainability Comes of Age,0
598,"Maybe they were better off in the Stone Age than we think. As early as 9,000 years ago, long before the wheel was invented, inhabitants of a Neolithic village in China were brewing a type of mead, or fermented honey and fruit, with an alcohol content of 10 percent, the archaeologist Patrick McGovern discovered recently. The finding by Dr. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, fits in with his thesis that the development of agriculture was the result of an irrepressible impulse toward drinking and intoxication, Spiegel Online reports. ''Consuming high energy sugar and alcohol was a fabulous solution for surviving in a hostile environment with few natural resources,'' said Dr. McGovern, a leading expert on ancient brewing.","The Stone Age Rocked, if You Liked Your Liquor",0

At one point during the attack, which took place late Friday, only a reinforced bathroom door protected the artist, Kurt Westergaard, 74, who was shielding his 5-year-old granddaughter as the attacker -- armed with an ax and a knife and shouting ''Revenge!'' and ''Blood!'' -- tried to smash through the door, according to an account the artist gave to the newspaper that employs him, Jyllands-Posten.",Cartoonist In Denmark Calls Attack 'Really Close',0
