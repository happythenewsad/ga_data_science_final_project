6,"A forgotten Robert Frost manuscript recently turned up in the basement of a Masonic lodge in Methuen, Mass. It's not a poem or an essay, but rather an attendance book Frost kept while teaching eighth grade at the Second Grammar School in Methuen in 1893. City officials say the book is somewhat the worse for wear, The Boston Globe reported, and they're applying for a $3,000 grant to restore and rebind it. The entries are apparently all in Frost's hand as he painstakingly ticked off, day by day, who showed up and who didn't. At the time Frost himself was only 17, or just a few years older than his pupils, and a recent dropout from Dartmouth College, where he hadn't even finished his first semester. But teachers didn't need credentials in those days, and besides, Frost had pull: his mother also taught at Second Grammar. Teaching was the family business. Frost's father was a teacher and a journalist, and after his death Frost's mother, who had been a teacher, supported the family by returning to the classroom. She even opened her own private school in Salem, N.H., and, not surprisingly her son, who was already writing and publishing poetry but needed a day job, was hired there too.",Absent From School?

The mission's responsibilities include strengthening governance, combating corruption, monitoring and protecting human rights and assuring fair and independently supervised elections. The current representative, Kai Eide, has been a disappointment. He has been too quiet about President Hamid Karzai's corrupt associates and too tolerant of the lax accounting practices at United Nations development programs. He was too slow, even slower than Washington, to condemn Mr. Karzai's blatant rigging of the August presidential election. Mr. Eide has announced that he will be leaving soon. Choosing the right successor is vitally important. Securing and rebuilding Afghanistan is an international, not just an American, responsibility. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, is currently considering three candidates: Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, Jean-Marie Guéhenno of France and Ian Martin of Britain.

A 2-7 record in 1963 hardly quieted such talk, and in its aftermath, 40-year-old Ara Parseghian was hired away from Northwestern. The fiery coach with the coal-black eyes oversaw a transformation that's still regarded as a miracle at a place where belief in them never wavers. Parseghian took the '64 Fighting Irish on a 9-1 joy ride that ended just seconds short of a national championship. The de-emphasis talk became an inaudible whisper.

Judge Lau was ruling on a lawsuit filed two years ago by The Herald, the Malaysian Roman Catholic Church's main publication, after the government blocked non-Muslims from translating ''God'' as ''Allah'' in their literature. The authorities have said that Allah is an Islamic word that should be used exclusively by Muslims.

It's a snapshot of Louis Armstrong in his dressing room at the Paramount Theater, in May 1937. He's in a thin black skullcap, sleeves rolled back, gnawing on a rib bone. He's holding what appears to be a goblet of beer. The look on his face is wary, distancing, maybe a little admonitory. He looks like a guy who'd rather be enjoying his meal in peace. The image bears some relevance to ''Struttin' With Some Barbecue,'' a New Year's booking at the Jazz Standard. Named after one of the immortal sides made by Armstrong's Hot Five -- ''the Old Testament of classic jazz,'' as Terry Teachout rightly observes in ''Pops: A Life of Louis Armstrong,'' his scrupulous new biography -- the engagement features two proud sons of New Orleans, the pianist Henry Butler and the alto saxophonist Donald Harrison.

The initial announcement on his Web site (vanmorrison.com) said that he was the proud father of a new son, George Ivan Morrison III.

Residents of this city saw what some supposed to be the Tillinghast aerial craft floating over the town, and to-night reports of well lighted air craft are coming in from all over Massachusetts. The appearance of the mysterious light over the city last night had been the one topic of discussion here to-day. There are a few persons who really believe that Mr. Tillinghast or some other aerial daredevil braved the cold winds and the darkness and sailed about over the town, but after sleeping over the affair the majority of the people concluded that some practical joker sent up a small hydrogen balloon last night carrying a lantern. All that is positively known about the matter is that two weeks ago Mr. Wallace E. Tillinghast, who is vice president of the Sure Seal Heating Company, sent for a reporter of the Worcester ''Telegram'' and told him the story about making a flight to New York city and return on the night of September 8 last.","100, 75, 50 Years Ago",0

453,"WHEN you think of Akira Kurosawa, you think, most likely, of swords and flags, of castles under siege, of men in dark armor and women in brilliant kimonos, of horses galloping to battle in driving rain. The movie that brought Kurosawa -- and Japanese cinema as a whole -- to the attention of the world, ''Rashomon'' (1950), was set in the distant past, and practically all the most celebrated films of the remaining 40-plus years of his career were historical dramas, too: ''The Seven Samurai'' (1954), ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), ''Yojimbo'' (1961), ''Sanjuro'' (1962) and ''Ran'' (1985). So it might seem a little strange that Film Forum's centennial Kurosawa retrospective should begin (on Wednesday) with a nine-day run of the 1949 urban noir ''Stray Dog,'' in which there isn't a horse or a castle in sight, and where the weapon of choice is a Colt pistol. It shouldn't. Of the 30 movies Kurosawa directed, better than half tell stories of present-day Japan, and a fair number of them, including ''Stray Dog,'' rank with his greatest works. ''Stray Dog,'' his ninth film, is a kind of police-procedural thriller, in which a young Tokyo homicide detective named Murakami (Toshiro Mifune) roams the crowded streets of the postwar city in search of his stolen gun. At first he merely feels humiliated, but before long much more painful emotions take hold. He learns, to his horror, that his gun is being used to commit robberies: one woman is seriously injured; the next dies. Murakami, crazed with grief and guilt, combs the seedier quarters of the sprawling city, where everybody looks hungry and desperate, wearied by an unrelenting summer heat. He trudges through this unwelcoming terrain with the grim persistence of a soldier making his way home after a lost campaign.",Kurosawa: Past and Present Tense,0

And while DVD sales declined by some $1 billion in 2009 from the previous year, sales of Blu-ray discs, according to data from the Digital Entertainment Group, rose by $200 million, partially offsetting the industry downturn.

Universal had bought a script he'd written with his brother and frequent collaborator, Daniel -- an offbeat comedy called ''Welcome to Buzzsaw'' -- and as it inched towards production, the pair landed a gig on the 1990 action film ''Darkman,'' an early hit for the director Sam Raimi.

The finding by Dr. McGovern, a biomolecular archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania Museum, fits in with his thesis that the development of agriculture was the result of an irrepressible impulse toward drinking and intoxication, Spiegel Online reports.

For those who has scratched their heads in confusion (or rolled their eyes) reading a music blog lately, the joke is uncomfortably close to the truth.

''I'm coming to the big apple to give NY what they've never seen, an escape inmate gone wild on Revis Island'' is well composed, but it doesn't resonate like an end-zone ''Riverdance.'' Ochocinco contains multitudes, so even he was moved to compliment Revis. ''Technique is awesome -- good patience at the line'' was among the few printable scouting reports. Revis was mostly silent, as one who can't get a word in edgewise often is. The Revis-Ochocinco battle will end in a stalemate, turning the Bengals' passing game into a series of 5-yard dump-offs to Brian Leonard. The Jets' passing game (what's left of it) will be shut down by Leon Hall, Johnathan Joseph and the solid Bengals secondary. That leaves both teams trying to run against great run defenses.

He was an outstanding dental practitioner in New York City and Ft. Myers, Florida. Mel learned the importance of painless dentistry from his father and excelled at treating complex and difficult cases. In his efforts to always explore new techniques, he invented a diamond tool that substantially lessened the time preparing teeth for crowns and bridges. Mel's creative genius played out in many other avenues. He wrote stage scripts for numerous musical shows, designed furniture and fixtures, created amazing mobiles, sculptures and metal works, and crafted pottery, where he developed unique glazing techniques. He was among the first to help the blind study textbooks through audio tapes by establishing groups of volunteers to record them. Mel designed ""flip books"" to help teach activities such as a golf swing and developed a forerunner of today's more advanced golf simulators. Mel was dedicated to the spirit and mission of Rotary International, having been a member at clubs in Ft. Myers and Sun City for many years. He was active in a variety of groups at Sun City Georgetown, including the Sun City Theater Group, the Computer Club, the Solos Club, and the Creative Crafts and Clay Club. Over his lifetime, Mel was active as a tennis player, golfer, snow skier, sailor, boatman, windsurfer, bocce player, and bridge player. He loved to dance with his beautiful wife, Moana Holt Owen. Mel's zest for life encompassed many disciplines. His elegance and refinement lent an air of grace to every event. He could regale partygoers with tales of worldwide travels while charming his partners on the dance floor. Mel was always a gentleman without ceasing to be a gentle man, one whose kindness will be fondly remembered. The true testament to Mel is the warmth and love which he inspired in the hearts of the many fortunate enough to have known him throughout his rich and rewarding life. Mel was born in Brooklyn, NY, on August 13, 1923. After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, Long Island University, and NYU Dental School, Mel served as an Army dentist in Alaska from 1946-47. He moved with Moana to Cape Coral, Florida, in 1975. After she passed on, he relocated to Sun City Georgetown in 1996. He leaves behind a lifetime treasure of loving memories for his son Mallard Owen and wife Judith Smith of Ashburn, Virginia; his daughter Meredith Owen of Round Rock, Texas; his sister, Alese Owen Pechter; his brother and sister-in-law, Edwin and Nancy Owen; and his nephews, John and Andrew Owen; and Stuart, Richard, Jay and Todd Pechter.<br><br>

The aides worked for Kenneth Feinberg, the government's special master for executive compensation, and they were awaiting submissions from companies that had received (and not yet paid back) billions in what federal regulations call ''exceptional assistance'' from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. The government had the authority to set compensation levels at those seven TARP recipients, and this was the companies' opportunity to plead for salaries and bonuses for each of its top 25 executives. Chrysler Financial and General Motors submitted their proposals -- about 2,000-plus pages each -- a few days before.

Gioia, kept an office for the past eight years. Mr. Van Bramer, 40, a former Queens Borough Public Library official, decided to keep the place, Suite No. 203. Mr. Gioia left Mr. Van Bramer a welcome note in the drawer of the big desk, along with this advice: Lock the windows and doors. The office had been broken into twice (burglars, not political operatives). The first time, the computers were stolen, which was problematic, Mr. Gioia said, because as chairman of the Council's Oversight and Investigations Committee, he had some sensitive information on those hard drives. As a worker changed the locks, Mr. Van Bramer surveyed the clutter of desks, phone wires and supplies. Ah, the glamour of public office. He said he would modernize the dingy décor with a hasty repainting and recarpeting job, and update Mr. Gioia's poster of Mookie Wilson, a Mets center fielder in the 1980s, with one of himself standing with José Reyes, the team's current shortstop. MR. GIOIA opened the Queens Boulevard office, with its view of the elevated No. 7 train, on the day of his inauguration, Jan. 1, 2002, and instituted a firm policy for the Manhattancentric officials who wanted to see him. ''I wouldn't meet with them unless they came to Queens, to this office,'' he explained, adding that Hillary Rodham Clinton was among those who made the trek to Woodside. Mr. Gioia, 36, who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for public advocate, will now put his political prowess and connections to work as a bank executive. He took with him his beloved Mookie poster but left the leather couch where industrious aides would sometimes grab some sleep, the volumes of the New York City Charter on the bookshelf, an aging television with a slot for a VHS tape, and the old desk behind a partition -- it belonged to a particularly messy employee who was required to hide her desk.

He was an outstanding dental practitioner in New York City and Ft. Myers, Florida. Mel learned the importance of painless dentistry from his father and excelled at treating complex and difficult cases. In his efforts to always explore new techniques, he invented a diamond tool that substantially lessened the time preparing teeth for crowns and bridges. Mel's creative genius played out in many other avenues. He wrote stage scripts for numerous musical shows, designed furniture and fixtures, created amazing mobiles, sculptures and metal works, and crafted pottery, where he developed unique glazing techniques. He was among the first to help the blind study textbooks through audio tapes by establishing groups of volunteers to record them. Mel designed ""flip books"" to help teach activities such as a golf swing and developed a forerunner of today's more advanced golf simulators. Mel was dedicated to the spirit and mission of Rotary International, having been a member at clubs in Ft. Myers and Sun City for many years. He was active in a variety of groups at Sun City Georgetown, including the Sun City Theater Group, the Computer Club, the Solos Club, and the Creative Crafts and Clay Club. Over his lifetime, Mel was active as a tennis player, golfer, snow skier, sailor, boatman, windsurfer, bocce player, and bridge player. He loved to dance with his beautiful wife, Moana Holt Owen. Mel's zest for life encompassed many disciplines. His elegance and refinement lent an air of grace to every event. He could regale partygoers with tales of worldwide travels while charming his partners on the dance floor. Mel was always a gentleman without ceasing to be a gentle man, one whose kindness will be fondly remembered. The true testament to Mel is the warmth and love which he inspired in the hearts of the many fortunate enough to have known him throughout his rich and rewarding life. Mel was born in Brooklyn, NY, on August 13, 1923. After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, Long Island University, and NYU Dental School, Mel served as an Army dentist in Alaska from 1946-47. He moved with Moana to Cape Coral, Florida, in 1975. After she passed on, he relocated to Sun City Georgetown in 1996. He leaves behind a lifetime treasure of loving memories for his son Mallard Owen and wife Judith Smith of Ashburn, Virginia; his daughter Meredith Owen of Round Rock, Texas; his sister, Alese Owen Pechter; his brother and sister-in-law, Edwin and Nancy Owen; and his nephews, John and Andrew Owen; and Stuart, Richard, Jay and Todd Pechter.","Paid Notice: Deaths  OWEN, MELVIN M.",0

Even the young male writers who, in the scope of their ambition, would appear to be the heirs apparent have repudiated the aggressive virility of their predecessors. After reading a sex scene in Philip Roth's latest novel, ''The Humbling,'' someone I know threw the book into the trash on a subway platform. It was not exactly feminist rage that motivated her. We have internalized the feminist critique pioneered by Kate Millett in ''Sexual Politics'' so completely that, as one of my students put it, ''we can do the math ourselves.'' Instead my acquaintance threw the book away on the grounds that the scene was disgusting, dated, redundant. But why, I kept wondering, did she have to throw it out? Did it perhaps retain a little of the provocative fire its author might have hoped for? Dovetailing with this private and admittedly limited anecdote, there is a punitive, vituperative quality in the published reviews that is always revealing of something larger in the culture, something beyond one aging writer's failure to produce fine enough sentences. All of which is to say: How is it possible that Philip Roth's sex scenes are still enraging us?",The Naked And the Conflicted,0

Rockefeller Sr. The problem is, as much as I've enjoyed these books, I don't really remember reading any of them. Certainly I know the main points. But didn't I, after underlining all those interesting parts, retain anything else?

753,"Caricature works wonders at skewering puffed-up demigods, moguls and celebrities by ripping off their false facades. For artists it is both a vent for frustration and a tool of dissent, but being good at it is never easy. Just getting a good likeness is hard enough; making it into a truly smart distortion takes a master manipulator. From the mid-'60s through the early 2000s, American caricature was most ingeniously and influentially practiced by the Brooklyn-born caricaturist and painter David Levine, who died at 83 on Dec. 29 of prostate cancer and other illnesses. Given the thousands of drawings he produced during his lengthy career, primarily for The New York Review of Books, but also for other periodicals, including Esquire, The New Yorker, Time and The New York Times, he laid claim to a distinctive linear style that was mimicked for decades by scores of less gifted cartoonists. The Levine line was as emblematic of his era -- from the Vietnam War through the Iraq War, covering presidents from Kennedy to Obama -- as were the graphic styles of the 19th- and early-20th-century cartoon luminaries Honoré Daumier, Thomas Nast and George Grosz.",Insight by a Thousand Strokes,1

806,"EATING THE DINOSAUR By Chuck Klosterman. Scribner, $25. There is considerable risk in trying to write intelligently about stupid stuff. Maybe a subject will be so superficial -- Abba, advertising, TV coverage of pro sports -- as to resist all inquisitions. Or maybe, as Klosterman believes, that's a stupid, lazy way to think. ''I've spent an inordinate amount of time searching for the underrated value in ostensibly stupid things,'' he writes in ''Eating the Dinosaur.'' In the course of the collection's 13 essays, Klosterman burrows into overexposed but underexplored departments of American pop culture. Declaring himself ''post-taste,'' he evaluates not the merits of certain phenomena but the ways we ''use'' them. He is unfailingly sincere, brimming with empathy, occasionally depressive and often weepy. Writing about the burnout of the basketball star Ralph Sampson in an essay about how we make some celebrities our ''slaves,'' Klosterman says, ''It seems to exemplify the saddest thing about sports and culture, which means it's pretty much the saddest thing about life that doesn't involve death or secrets.'' On canned laughter: ''Build a machine that tells people when to cry. That's what we need. We need more crying.'' Such statements reveal the depth of Klosterman's obsessions, to which he is of course entitled, though he may be slightly exaggerating the importance of sports. But Klosterman doesn't think he is exaggerating; his essays rely on his deeply personal momentum. He agonizes over his material, offering himself as whipping boy, that he might take on our collective cultural sins.",Nonfiction Chronicle,0

The raging economic growth rates of China and India are well known, though their rise is part of a broader trend in the economic development of poorer countries.

No doubt the president was trying to acknowledge and channel the resentments in his own party -- and in the country -- when he told CBS's Steve Kroft during a ''60 Minutes'' interview, ''I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.'' Yet the rhetorical slap felt a little flat. In part it was the oddity of the epithet, a musty Washington cliché that had the effect of making Obama, the most urbane president in a half-century, sound as if he belonged in some black-and-white talkie from the '40s. Why, listen here: I oughtta pound you -- and all your fat-cat pals! But it was also Obama's body language, the dutiful way in which he delivered the line and elaborated on it, that gave the impression of a dapper man trying on an ill-fitting suit. When the president sat down for an amiable conversation with a group of those very same fat cats the next day, it only reinforced the impression among disenchanted Democrats that Obama shows more deference to moneyed interests than he does to liberals.",No-Commoner Obama,0

999,"One of Spain's most popular holiday events, the colorful Procession of the Three Kings, will proceed down the Paseo de la Castellana from Nuevos Ministerios to Plaza de Cibeles on Friday between 6:30 p.m. and 9 p.m. It features the elaborately dressed kings, their pages and helpers, who ride on floats distributing sweets to the children lining the route. There are at least 30 carriages, theatrical re-enactments, dancers, musicians, jugglers, street performers, royal pages, giant puppets and many other entertaining characters.According to the Bible, at this time of year, three wise and powerful kings brought gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the infant Jesus. To celebrate the occasion, on Jan. 5, children in Spain go to bed early, awaiting the morning, when they hope to find the presents that they requested of the three kings in letters written on Boxing Day, Dec. 26. They leave shoes on windowsills or balconies or under the Christmas tree to be filled with toys.","Madrid to Celebrate Three Kings, and the Gift of Innocence",1

1011,"A recent article in our magazine discussed the work of the artist Shea Hembrey, who fabricated an astounding catalog filled with the work of 100 artists of his own creation. The article by Sara Corbett discusses Hembrey's life, his work and, briefly, his locale while completing the catalog: New Jersey. Frenchtown, to be exact. For me, as a native of the state, this small part of the story filled me with pride. The Garden State is so often mocked for everything from its accent to its aroma that my ears perk up whenever it's mentioned without contempt. Perhaps because of this proclivity, I've noticed a handful of artists' projects recently that have been influenced or directly inspired by the state, even if nowhere near it. Here are a few of my favorites:",The Fertile Ground of the Garden State,1
