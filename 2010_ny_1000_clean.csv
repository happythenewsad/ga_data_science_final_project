The mission's responsibilities include strengthening governance, combating corruption, monitoring and protecting human rights and assuring fair and independently supervised elections. The current representative, Kai Eide, has been a disappointment. He has been too quiet about President Hamid Karzai's corrupt associates and too tolerant of the lax accounting practices at United Nations development programs. He was too slow, even slower than Washington, to condemn Mr. Karzai's blatant rigging of the August presidential election. Mr. Eide has announced that he will be leaving soon. Choosing the right successor is vitally important. Securing and rebuilding Afghanistan is an international, not just an American, responsibility. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, is currently considering three candidates: Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, Jean-Marie Guéhenno of France and Ian Martin of Britain.

Booked at the Music Hall of Williamsburg for a two-night New Year's Eve celebration, the band was also closing out its 10th anniversary, and showcasing acts from the roster of its new label, Royal Family Records. On top of all that there came an announcement from Soulive's drummer, Alan Evans: In March the group will be in residence for two weeks at Brooklyn Bowl, with guests every night. (More information about that run, naturally being billed as Bowlive, is at brooklynbowl.com.)

Ms. Dalthel Ling--more affectionately known as ""Aunt Moy"" to her family--died due to renal failure on Christmas afternoon much like her only daughter who had succumb to cancer Christmas 1997. Ms. Ling was a proud member of a rare ethnic subset, Chinese-Jamaican. Her love of her family was matched only by her love of world. She'd set foot on every continent in her lifetime, took a Safari in her 60s and even found her way to an Amsterdam cafe in her 70s. Ms. Ling was described as the family's matriarch, often the patron saint of lodging, and its businesswoman whose business often seemed to be the family itself. She is survived by her grandson, Collin Hunt, 29, granddaughter Julian Hunt, 27, and several cousins, nieces, nephews, extended relatives and dear friends.

The federal International Trade Commission said this week that it would investigate the complaint, which was filed Dec. 1. The case is part of an escalating two-year legal battle between the two companies over inventions used in liquid-crystal display televisions. The Samsung patents relate to the way LCD screens portray the black and white portion of images. Samsung is seeking to block imports of Sharp Aquos HDTVs made in Mexico. Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, won an earlier trade commission order banning Sharp televisions from the United States. That case is on appeal. Sharp continues to import its televisions, saying it has altered the product to avoid using the Samsung invention. Samsung says Sharp is flouting the trade commission's order. A commission judge, Paul Luckern, said he would hear arguments on the dispute in April and release his findings by July 19.","Washington trade agency will investigate Samsung's latest patent-infrigement claims, which seek to block US imports of LCD Tvs made by Sharp Corporation; case is part of two-year legal battle between companies over inventions used in liquid-crystal display televisions (S)",2,[],The New York Times,[],U.S. To Investigate Trade Dispute Over LCD TVs,"[{""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO""}, {""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""SHARP CORP""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""TELEVISION SETS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""TELEVISION""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""SUITS AND LITIGATION""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""INVENTIONS AND PATENTS""}]",2010-01-02T00:00:00Z,article,Business/Financial Desk,Technology; Business,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Bloomberg"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""NEWS""}], ""original""=>""By BLOOMBERG NEWS""}",News,4fd276c98eb7c8105d837e6b,178

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/movies/03kurosawa.html,"Of the 30 movies Kurosawa directed, better than half tell stories of present-day Japan, and a fair number of them, including “Stray Dog,” rank with his greatest works.","WHEN you think of Akira Kurosawa, you think, most likely, of swords and flags, of castles under siege, of men in dark armor and women in brilliant kimonos, of horses galloping to battle in driving rain. The movie that brought Kurosawa -- and Japanese cinema as a whole -- to the attention of the world, ''Rashomon'' (1950), was set in the distant past, and practically all the most celebrated films of the remaining 40-plus years of his career were historical dramas, too: ''The Seven Samurai'' (1954), ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), ''Yojimbo'' (1961), ''Sanjuro'' (1962) and ''Ran'' (1985). So it might seem a little strange that Film Forum's centennial Kurosawa retrospective should begin (on Wednesday) with a nine-day run of the 1949 urban noir ''Stray Dog,'' in which there isn't a horse or a castle in sight, and where the weapon of choice is a Colt pistol. It shouldn't. Of the 30 movies Kurosawa directed, better than half tell stories of present-day Japan, and a fair number of them, including ''Stray Dog,'' rank with his greatest works. ''Stray Dog,'' his ninth film, is a kind of police-procedural thriller, in which a young Tokyo homicide detective named Murakami (Toshiro Mifune) roams the crowded streets of the postwar city in search of his stolen gun. At first he merely feels humiliated, but before long much more painful emotions take hold. He learns, to his horror, that his gun is being used to commit robberies: one woman is seriously injured; the next dies. Murakami, crazed with grief and guilt, combs the seedier quarters of the sprawling city, where everybody looks hungry and desperate, wearied by an unrelenting summer heat. He trudges through this unwelcoming terrain with the grim persistence of a soldier making his way home after a lost campaign.",Terrence Rafferty article on films of Akira Kurosawa on occasion of Film Forum's centennial retrospective; photos (L),12,[],The New York Times,"[{""url""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/thumbStandard.jpg"", ""subtype""=>""thumbnail"", ""legacy""=>{""hasthumbnail""=>""Y"", ""thumbnailheight""=>75, ""thumbnail""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/thumbStandard.jpg""}, ""type""=>""image"", ""height""=>75}, {""width""=>395, ""url""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/sfSpan.jpg"", ""height""=>250, ""subtype""=>""xlarge"", ""legacy""=>{""xlargewidth""=>395, ""xlargeheight""=>250, ""xlarge""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/sfSpan.jpg"", ""hasxlarge""=>""Y""}, ""type""=>""image""}]",Kurosawa: Past and Present Tense,"[{""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""KUROSAWA, AKIRA""}, {""name""=>""glocations"", ""value""=>""JAPAN""}, {""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""FILM FORUM""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""MOVIES""}]",2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,article,Arts and Leisure Desk,Movies; Arts,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Terrence"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""RAFFERTY""}], ""original""=>""By TERRENCE RAFFERTY""}",News,4fd27d998eb7c8105d8456e7,1252

And while DVD sales declined by some $1 billion in 2009 from the previous year, sales of Blu-ray discs, according to data from the Digital Entertainment Group, rose by $200 million, partially offsetting the industry downturn.

When I finally got to America myself, I found that not only were the natives friendly and hospitable, they were also incredibly polite. No one tells you this about Americans, but once you notice it, it becomes one of their defining characteristics, especially when they're abroad. This is very strange, or at least it says something strange about the way that perception routinely conforms to the preconceptions it would appear to contradict.

Is this therapy or tabloid voyeurism?,"Last spring, at the Pasadena Recovery Center, while staff members were doing their morning rounds, three men sat behind the closed door of a dim in-patient bedroom. Members of a video production team, they were monitoring live feeds on glowing screens in a part of the Los Angeles drug-and-alcohol unit then serving as an ad-hoc command center for ''Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew'' -- a reality show on which celebrities who habitually alter their realities receive treatment for their addictions from a celebrity. On TV. Three mounted widescreens were broken into a dozen digital monitors, each showing a face from television past: Dennis Rodman, Heidi Fleiss, Mackenzie Phillips, Tom Sizemore and other less-celebrated substance abusers filled surveillance shots from around the building, the composite grid of video screens suggesting ''Hollywood Squares'' as directed by David Cronenberg. In one square, Sizemore, an actor known for playing hardboiled military men in such movies as ''Black Hawk Down'' and ''Saving Private Ryan,'' lay half conscious in his bed, detoxing from heroin, crystal meth, benzodiazepines and marijuana. He'd been in that state for two days, said Mark Perez, the show's supervising producer, which didn't seem to augur for great TV.

Universal had bought a script he'd written with his brother and frequent collaborator, Daniel -- an offbeat comedy called ''Welcome to Buzzsaw'' -- and as it inched towards production, the pair landed a gig on the 1990 action film ''Darkman,'' an early hit for the director Sam Raimi. In 1992 ''Welcome to Buzzsaw'' arrived in theaters, renamed ''Out on a Limb'' and starring Matthew Broderick. ''I was incredibly lucky,'' Josh Goldin said on a recent afternoon, sitting in a downtown Manhattan hotel lounge. And then, for the next 17 years, Mr. Goldin became a ghost. He worked on projects that either never came out or made it to theaters without his name on them. ''I wrote scripts that never went anywhere,'' he said, ''and I did rewrites for projects that looked like they might go somewhere and then didn't.''

Love, not architecture, is the focus of Boyle's novel about Frank Lloyd Wright. Boyle views his protagonist through the lens of his messy relationships with women and divides his story into sections corresponding to Wright's major romances. In the Book Review, Joanna Scott praised the novel as a ''powerful new chapter'' of Boyle's ''hilarious and terrifying fictional history of utopian longing in America,'' a ''mesmerizing story of women who invest everything, at great risk, in . . . Wright.'' THE MERCY PAPERS: A Memoir of Three Weeks, by Robin Romm. (Scribner, $13.)

Romm writes with ''fresh and uncompromising'' prose, ''fearless, scathing honesty'' and magnetic anger, Cohen said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/review/PaperRow-t.html,Paperback books of particular interest.,"THE WOMEN, by T. C. Boyle (Penguin, $16.) Love, not architecture, is the focus of Boyle's novel about Frank Lloyd Wright. Boyle views his protagonist through the lens of his messy relationships with women and divides his story into sections corresponding to Wright's major romances. In the Book Review, Joanna Scott praised the novel as a ''powerful new chapter'' of Boyle's ''hilarious and terrifying fictional history of utopian longing in America,'' a ''mesmerizing story of women who invest everything, at great risk, in . . . Wright.'' THE MERCY PAPERS: A Memoir of Three Weeks, by Robin Romm. (Scribner, $13.) This ''furious blaze of a book,'' as our reviewer, Leah Hager Cohen, described it, explores Romm's anguish over her 56-year-old mother's impending death from breast cancer. Romm writes with ''fresh and uncompromising'' prose, ''fearless, scathing honesty'' and magnetic anger, Cohen said. Death also shadows Diana Athill's SOMEWHERE TOWARDS THE END: A Memoir(Norton, $13.95), but she contemplates its approach from the perspective of a long life. A celebrated London editor, Athill, now 92, speaks gracefully and with good cheer about the losses and gains of old age.

One has inched ever closer to the required 75 percent approval from voters and is probably eagerly awaiting the announcement of the new class Wednesday. The other is close to being bumped off the ballot for too little support.

He was an eight-time Gold Glover with a golden arm to match. In his first year on the ballot, in 2002, he received 45.3 percent of the votes but he climbed to 67.3 percent last year. Dale Murphy, the longtime Atlanta Braves star, managed only 19.3 percent of the votes in his first year (1999) and declined to 11.5 percent in 2009. Murphy had 1,700 fewer plate appearances than Dawson because of injuries, but he hit 398 home runs, won Most Valuable Player awards in 1982 and 1983, and was awarded five Gold Gloves in center over 18 seasons. He is typically considered a ''close but no'' guy, his brief stretch of greatness from 1982 to '87 followed by a sharp decline.

The question re-emerged in Congress last month afterPresident Obama announced he would send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, and it is likely to be a major issue as lawmakers return to work in January. Reaching back into the nation's history books, some lawmakers are suggesting a war bond program similar to those used during the Civil War and both World Wars. Such a program might reduce the country's reliance on foreign borrowing and avoid a tax increase.","Some economists fear that instituting war bonds program to help pay for Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as some legislators are calling for, could harm economy; suggest it would encourage people to set aside money instead of spending it, which could hamper recovery by taking money out of circulation; while many experts believe program could be morale booster, they also believe that tax increase is inevitable; photo (M)",2,[],The New York Times,[],Buying a Share of Victory.

In photos that seem straight out of an American Apparel billboard, a young woman poses in the T-shirt, which asks, ''What kind of music do u listen 2?'' and offers, in a matrix of small type, more than 200 underground musical styles, both real (shoegaze, crab-core) and fake (Sufjan-house, crab-gaze). For those who has scratched their heads in confusion (or rolled their eyes) reading a music blog lately, the joke is uncomfortably close to the truth.

He was an outstanding dental practitioner in New York City and Ft. Myers, Florida. Mel learned the importance of painless dentistry from his father and excelled at treating complex and difficult cases. In his efforts to always explore new techniques, he invented a diamond tool that substantially lessened the time preparing teeth for crowns and bridges. Mel's creative genius played out in many other avenues. He wrote stage scripts for numerous musical shows, designed furniture and fixtures, created amazing mobiles, sculptures and metal works, and crafted pottery, where he developed unique glazing techniques. He was among the first to help the blind study textbooks through audio tapes by establishing groups of volunteers to record them. Mel designed ""flip books"" to help teach activities such as a golf swing and developed a forerunner of today's more advanced golf simulators. Mel was dedicated to the spirit and mission of Rotary International, having been a member at clubs in Ft. Myers and Sun City for many years. He was active in a variety of groups at Sun City Georgetown, including the Sun City Theater Group, the Computer Club, the Solos Club, and the Creative Crafts and Clay Club. Over his lifetime, Mel was active as a tennis player, golfer, snow skier, sailor, boatman, windsurfer, bocce player, and bridge player. He loved to dance with his beautiful wife, Moana Holt Owen. Mel's zest for life encompassed many disciplines. His elegance and refinement lent an air of grace to every event. He could regale partygoers with tales of worldwide travels while charming his partners on the dance floor. Mel was always a gentleman without ceasing to be a gentle man, one whose kindness will be fondly remembered. The true testament to Mel is the warmth and love which he inspired in the hearts of the many fortunate enough to have known him throughout his rich and rewarding life. Mel was born in Brooklyn, NY, on August 13, 1923. After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, Long Island University, and NYU Dental School, Mel served as an Army dentist in Alaska from 1946-47. He moved with Moana to Cape Coral, Florida, in 1975. After she passed on, he relocated to Sun City Georgetown in 1996. He leaves behind a lifetime treasure of loving memories for his son Mallard Owen and wife Judith Smith of Ashburn, Virginia; his daughter Meredith Owen of Round Rock, Texas; his sister, Alese Owen Pechter; his brother and sister-in-law, Edwin and Nancy Owen; and his nephews, John and Andrew Owen; and Stuart, Richard, Jay and Todd Pechter.<br><br>

She was the adoring grandmother of Braden Storm Blacker, whom he fondly called ""Gigi"". Ginny was devoted to her sisters (""the Kelly Girls"") and brothers-in-law: Susie and Bill Untereker and Meg and Kenny Rehders. She was also the loving and caring aunt of seven nephews and nieces. Ginny was a woman of great style, intellectual curiosity and limitless laughter. She truly loved life, family and her many interests. Ginny was the consummate--and constant--hostess. She was a fabulous, creative cook whose generous hospitality will always be remembered by her many friends. Ginny traveled all over the world with her husband--each trip delighting her more than the last. At home, she was an avid reader and was actively involved in doing good for others. She helped launch the Westhampton Beach Performing Arts Center and serving as a Gala Chair for Family Counseling Services. Ginny's sense of humor, positive spirit and sense of humanity were an inspiration for all who knew her. Her family and her friends were her life.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/weekinreview/03schillinger.html,Fear of terrorism can kill the impulse to get on a plane and see the world. No one has tallied the adventures not dared since 9/11.,"Everyone knows that flying in a plane is potentially dangerous -- just as everyone knows that climbing Mount Everest is dangerous. What goes up must come down; and if you put yourself at a great height, you put yourself at risk of falling, though the odds of perishing in a plane crash are one in ten million, whereas for every ten Everest climbers who reach the peak, one dies ... a far less comfortable margin. One reason that airports have bars, and that flight attendants ply passengers with beer, wine and cocktails, is that flight industry higher-ups are well aware that a drink or two can calm the nerves of timorous fliers, and that indeed most of their customers fear air travel to some degree. If you doubt the truth of this, take a look at your seatmates the next time a plane you're on hits an air pocket and drops before righting itself. You'll see your fellow passengers (some of them, anyhow) praying -- hoping divine intervention will keep the magical container aloft. Regina Spektor wove this thought into her album, ''Far'' last June, in the song ''Laughing With,'' which goes, ''No one laughs at God when their airplane starts to uncontrollably shake.'' It's the 21st century, but that doesn't keep flying from remaining, on one level, an act of faith.","Many people have innate fear of flying, and that fear has been compounded in last decade by acts of terrorism; while terror incidents barely register statistically, they cause public to panic and feel vulnerable; in wake of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's attempted sabotage, government and air traffic officials are scrambling to reassure citizenry about safety of air travel; photo (M)",1,[],The New York Times,[],The Price of High Anxiety,"[{""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""ABDULMUTALLAB, UMAR FAROUK""}, {""name""=>""glocations"", ""value""=>""YEMEN""}, {""name""=>""glocations"", ""value""=>""DETROIT (MICH)""}, {""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""NORTHWEST AIRLINES""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""ACCIDENTS AND SAFETY""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""BOMBS AND EXPLOSIVES""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""SECURITY AND WARNING SYSTEMS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""TERRORISM""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""ANXIETY""}]",2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,article,Week in Review Desk,Week in Review,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Liesl"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""SCHILLINGER""}], ""original""=>""By LIESL SCHILLINGER""}",News,4fd292998eb7c8105d86c0e7,1411

Gioia’s office space in Woodside, Queens.","JIMMY VAN BRAMER, one of 13 new members elected in November to the New York City Council, lives a few blocks away from 47-01 Queens Boulevard in Woodside, where his predecessor, Eric N. Gioia, kept an office for the past eight years. Mr. Van Bramer, 40, a former Queens Borough Public Library official, decided to keep the place, Suite No. 203. Mr. Gioia left Mr. Van Bramer a welcome note in the drawer of the big desk, along with this advice: Lock the windows and doors. The office had been broken into twice (burglars, not political operatives). The first time, the computers were stolen, which was problematic, Mr. Gioia said, because as chairman of the Council's Oversight and Investigations Committee, he had some sensitive information on those hard drives. As a worker changed the locks, Mr. Van Bramer surveyed the clutter of desks, phone wires and supplies. Ah, the glamour of public office. He said he would modernize the dingy décor with a hasty repainting and recarpeting job, and update Mr. Gioia's poster of Mookie Wilson, a Mets center fielder in the 1980s, with one of himself standing with José Reyes, the team's current shortstop. MR. GIOIA opened the Queens Boulevard office, with its view of the elevated No. 7 train, on the day of his inauguration, Jan. 1, 2002, and instituted a firm policy for the Manhattancentric officials who wanted to see him. ''I wouldn't meet with them unless they came to Queens, to this office,'' he explained, adding that Hillary Rodham Clinton was among those who made the trek to Woodside. Mr. Gioia, 36, who ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for public advocate, will now put his political prowess and connections to work as a bank executive.

He was an outstanding dental practitioner in New York City and Ft. Myers, Florida. Mel learned the importance of painless dentistry from his father and excelled at treating complex and difficult cases. In his efforts to always explore new techniques, he invented a diamond tool that substantially lessened the time preparing teeth for crowns and bridges. Mel's creative genius played out in many other avenues. He wrote stage scripts for numerous musical shows, designed furniture and fixtures, created amazing mobiles, sculptures and metal works, and crafted pottery, where he developed unique glazing techniques. He was among the first to help the blind study textbooks through audio tapes by establishing groups of volunteers to record them. Mel designed ""flip books"" to help teach activities such as a golf swing and developed a forerunner of today's more advanced golf simulators. Mel was dedicated to the spirit and mission of Rotary International, having been a member at clubs in Ft. Myers and Sun City for many years. He was active in a variety of groups at Sun City Georgetown, including the Sun City Theater Group, the Computer Club, the Solos Club, and the Creative Crafts and Clay Club. Over his lifetime, Mel was active as a tennis player, golfer, snow skier, sailor, boatman, windsurfer, bocce player, and bridge player. He loved to dance with his beautiful wife, Moana Holt Owen. Mel's zest for life encompassed many disciplines. His elegance and refinement lent an air of grace to every event. He could regale partygoers with tales of worldwide travels while charming his partners on the dance floor. Mel was always a gentleman without ceasing to be a gentle man, one whose kindness will be fondly remembered. The true testament to Mel is the warmth and love which he inspired in the hearts of the many fortunate enough to have known him throughout his rich and rewarding life. Mel was born in Brooklyn, NY, on August 13, 1923. After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, Long Island University, and NYU Dental School, Mel served as an Army dentist in Alaska from 1946-47. He moved with Moana to Cape Coral, Florida, in 1975. After she passed on, he relocated to Sun City Georgetown in 1996. He leaves behind a lifetime treasure of loving memories for his son Mallard Owen and wife Judith Smith of Ashburn, Virginia; his daughter Meredith Owen of Round Rock, Texas; his sister, Alese Owen Pechter; his brother and sister-in-law, Edwin and Nancy Owen; and his nephews, John and Andrew Owen; and Stuart, Richard, Jay and Todd Pechter.",,22,[],The New York Times,[],"Paid Notice: Deaths  OWEN, MELVIN M.","[{""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""OWEN, MELVIN M.""}]",2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,article,Classified,Paid Death Notices,,,Paid Death Notice,4fd278458eb7c8105d83a95f,442

In 2006, that gap had grown so large that Warren Buffett warned it was a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt. The bursting of the housing bubble and the ensuing credit crisis caused consumer spending to drop abruptly, and imports plunged as a result. Exports fell as well, but not as sharply, so the trade gap shrank from $65 billion in May 2006 to $26 billion in May 2009. But as economists have noted, when the economy began to recover last fall, the trade deficit began to rise again as consumers felt freer to spend money on flat-screen TV's and other luxury items, many of which come from China.

In 2006, that gap had grown so large that Warren Buffett warned it was a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt. The bursting of the housing bubble and the ensuing credit crisis caused consumer spending to drop abruptly, and imports plunged as a result. Exports fell as well, but not as sharply, so the trade gap shrank from $65 billion in May 2006 to $26 billion in May 2009. But as economists have noted, when the economy began to recover last fall, the trade deficit began to rise again as consumers felt freer to spend money on flat-screen TV's and other luxury items, many of which come from China.

During that time she resided in Ho-Ho-Kus, Parsippany and Hawthorne, NJ. She retired in 2002 because of disabling injuries she suffered in an automobile accident. She has lived in South Orange, NJ for the last six years. Born in New York City, she grew up in Briarcliff Manor, NY and Grosse Pointe Farms, MI. After Beth's automobile accident she was fortunate to discover JESPY, an organization based in South Orange that specializes in providing a community of care and friendship for adults with disabilities. The staff and clients of JESPY, as well as the residents of South Orange, provided a welcoming environment that sustained and enriched her life. She is survived by her father, David A. DeWahl of Vero Beach, FL, an older brother David, Jr. of Greenwich, CT, a younger brother Duncan C. of Maitland, FL, three nephews and two nieces. Her marriage in 1984 ended in divorce. In the last few years she has been cared for by Shan Atkinson. Her death, attributed to sepsis, occurred after a series of operations for a chronic foot ailment. A memorial service, followed by a reception, will be held at 11am on January 9, 2010 at House of Prayer Episcopal Church, 407 Broad Street, Newark, NJ.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/review/Beyer-t.html,Memoirs by Stephen Elliott and Richard Rushfield; and essay collections from Chuck Klosterman and Daniel Nester.,"EATING THE DINOSAUR By Chuck Klosterman. Scribner, $25. There is considerable risk in trying to write intelligently about stupid stuff. Maybe a subject will be so superficial -- Abba, advertising, TV coverage of pro sports -- as to resist all inquisitions. Or maybe, as Klosterman believes, that's a stupid, lazy way to think. ''I've spent an inordinate amount of time searching for the underrated value in ostensibly stupid things,'' he writes in ''Eating the Dinosaur.'' In the course of the collection's 13 essays, Klosterman burrows into overexposed but underexplored departments of American pop culture. Declaring himself ''post-taste,'' he evaluates not the merits of certain phenomena but the ways we ''use'' them. He is unfailingly sincere, brimming with empathy, occasionally depressive and often weepy. Writing about the burnout of the basketball star Ralph Sampson in an essay about how we make some celebrities our ''slaves,'' Klosterman says, ''It seems to exemplify the saddest thing about sports and culture, which means it's pretty much the saddest thing about life that doesn't involve death or secrets.'' On canned laughter: ''Build a machine that tells people when to cry. That's what we need. We need more crying.'' Such statements reveal the depth of Klosterman's obsessions, to which he is of course entitled, though he may be slightly exaggerating the importance of sports. But Klosterman doesn't think he is exaggerating; his essays rely on his deeply personal momentum. He agonizes over his material, offering himself as whipping boy, that he might take on our collective cultural sins.","Gregory Beyer reviews books Eating the Dinosaur by Chuck Klosterman, The Adderall Diaries: A Memoir of Moods, Masochism, and Murder by Stephen Elliott, Don't Follow Me, I'm Lost: A Memoir of Hampshire College in the Twilight of the 80's by Richard Rushfield and How To Be Inappropriate by Daniel Nester; photos from book Burtynsky: Oil by Edward Burtynsky (M)",22,[],The New York Times,"[{""width""=>500, ""url""=>""images/2010/01/03/books/review/Beyer-t_CA0/popup.jpg"", ""height""=>794, ""subtype""=>""xlarge"", ""legacy""=>{""xlargewidth""=>500, ""xlargeheight""=>794, ""xlarge""=>""images/2010/01/03/books/review/Beyer-t_CA0/popup.jpg"", ""hasxlarge""=>""Y""}, ""type""=>""image""}]",Nonfiction Chronicle,"[{""name""=>""creative_works"", ""value""=>""DON'T FOLLOW ME, I'M LOST (BOOK)""}, {""name""=>""creative_works"", ""value""=>""HOW TO BE INAPPROPRIATE (BOOK)""}, {""name""=>""creative_works"", ""value""=>""ADDERALL DIARIES, THE (BOOK)""}, {""name""=>""creative_works"", ""value""=>""EATING THE DINOSAUR (BOOK)""}, {""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""BURTYNSKY, EDWARD""}, {""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""NESTER, DANIEL""}, {""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""KLOSTERMAN, CHUCK""}, {""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""ELLIOTT, STEPHEN""}, {""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""RUSHFIELD, RICHARD""}, {""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""REVIEWS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""BOOKS AND LITERATURE""}]",2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,article,Book Review Desk,Arts; Books,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Gregory"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""BEYER""}], ""original""=>""By GREGORY BEYER""}",Review,4fd275a38eb7c8105d835894,1075

Her friends had positions lined up, so she wanted one, too. She went to the career counseling center and signed up for interviews for 10 different jobs, none of which she particularly wanted. Now a financial planner, Ms. Goodwin is still not sure she ever figured out what she wanted to do. As the employment rate steadily slipped and her line of work became increasingly inhospitable, she, like many alumni around the country, has returned to her university's career center to begin the search process all over again. ''It's a humbling experience to go back to your old school and be asking for help,'' says Ms. Goodwin, who is now considering a career in corporate education.","Traditionally, university career counselors do not serve graduates 6 or 12 months after they have finished college; however, with influx of requests from alumni who are now or fear they soon will be unemployed, career services offices have become hub for disenchanted graduates; some colleges charge alumni for counseling sessions, while others are free; photos (M)",24,[],The New York Times,"[{""credit""=>""Rutgers alumni advise job-seekers at a speed-networking seminar."", ""url""=>""http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/01/03/education/20100103ALUMNI-ss_index.html"", ""rank""=>""1"", ""height""=>700, ""caption""=>""High-Speed Connections"", ""legacy""=>{""MultimediaPopupHeight1""=>""700"", ""MultimediaType1""=>""Slideshow"", ""MultimediaPopupWidth1""=>""750"", ""MultimediaUrl1""=>""http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2010/01/03/education/20100103ALUMNI-ss_index.html"", ""MultimediaSummary1""=>""Rutgers alumni advise job-seekers at a speed-networking seminar."", ""MultimediaHeadline1""=>""High-Speed Connections""}, ""type""=>""Slideshow"", ""width""=>750}, {""url""=>""images/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03alumniSPAN/thumbStandard.jpg"", ""subtype""=>""thumbnail"", ""legacy""=>{""hasthumbnail""=>""Y"", ""thumbnailheight""=>75, ""thumbnail""=>""images/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03alumniSPAN/thumbStandard.jpg""}, ""type""=>""image"", ""height""=>75}, {""width""=>600, ""url""=>""images/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03alumniSPAN/articleLarge.jpg"", ""height""=>198, ""subtype""=>""xlarge"", ""legacy""=>{""xlargewidth""=>600, ""xlargeheight""=>198, ""xlarge""=>""images/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03alumniSPAN/articleLarge.jpg"", ""hasxlarge""=>""Y""}, ""type""=>""image""}]",You Can Go Back Again,"[{""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""UNEMPLOYMENT""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""LAYOFFS AND JOB REDUCTIONS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""LABOR AND JOBS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""CAREERS AND PROFESSIONS""}]",2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,article,Education Life Supplement,Education; U.S.,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Rachel"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""AVIV""}], ""original""=>""By RACHEL AVIV""}",News,4fd292998eb7c8105d86c0da,548

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/magazine/03FOB-WWLN-t.html,He isn’t a populist. That doesn’t mean he’s not a progressive.,"There was something discordant, even tinny, about Barack Obama's attempt to castigate Wall Street last month. No doubt the president was trying to acknowledge and channel the resentments in his own party -- and in the country -- when he told CBS's Steve Kroft during a ''60 Minutes'' interview, ''I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street.'' Yet the rhetorical slap felt a little flat. In part it was the oddity of the epithet, a musty Washington cliché that had the effect of making Obama, the most urbane president in a half-century, sound as if he belonged in some black-and-white talkie from the '40s.

Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law helped keep ''Sherlock Holmes'' (Warner Brothers) at No. 2 with a little more than $38 million, bringing its total to about $140.7 million. ''Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel'' (Fox) remained at No. 3 in its second week, with $36 million ($157 million, total). Nancy Meyers's romantic comedy ''It's Complicated'' (Universal) finished with $18 million, putting it in fourth place with about $60 million total. And though Sandra Bullock was the top box office draw of 2009, ''The Blind Side'' (Warner Brothers) drew only a little more than $12 million in its seventh week in theaters. Still, it was enough to tip it over the $200 million mark, with $209 million total.","Variety reports that James Cameron film Avatar was number one in domestic ticket sales, with just over $68 million,over New Year's weekend; photo (S)",2,[],The New York Times,[],'Avatar' On Top Again,"[{""name""=>""creative_works"", ""value""=>""AVATAR (MOVIE)""}, {""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""CAMERON, JAMES""}, {""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""VARIETY""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""SALES""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""MOVIES""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""FINANCES""}]",2010-01-04T00:00:00Z,article,The Arts/Cultural Desk,Movies; Arts,,"{""person""=>[{""firstname""=>""Rachel"", ""middlename""=>""Lee"", ""lastname""=>""HARRIS"", ""rank""=>1, ""role""=>""reported"", ""organization""=>""""}], ""original""=>""Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS""}",News,4fd293208eb7c8105d86d39b,196
