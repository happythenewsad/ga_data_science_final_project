The mission's responsibilities include strengthening governance, combating corruption, monitoring and protecting human rights and assuring fair and independently supervised elections. The current representative, Kai Eide, has been a disappointment. He has been too quiet about President Hamid Karzai's corrupt associates and too tolerant of the lax accounting practices at United Nations development programs. He was too slow, even slower than Washington, to condemn Mr. Karzai's blatant rigging of the August presidential election. Mr. Eide has announced that he will be leaving soon. Choosing the right successor is vitally important. Securing and rebuilding Afghanistan is an international, not just an American, responsibility. Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, is currently considering three candidates: Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, Jean-Marie Guéhenno of France and Ian Martin of Britain.

Booked at the Music Hall of Williamsburg for a two-night New Year's Eve celebration, the band was also closing out its 10th anniversary, and showcasing acts from the roster of its new label, Royal Family Records. On top of all that there came an announcement from Soulive's drummer, Alan Evans: In March the group will be in residence for two weeks at Brooklyn Bowl, with guests every night. (More information about that run, naturally being billed as Bowlive, is at brooklynbowl.com.)

Ms. Dalthel Ling--more affectionately known as ""Aunt Moy"" to her family--died due to renal failure on Christmas afternoon much like her only daughter who had succumb to cancer Christmas 1997. Ms. Ling was a proud member of a rare ethnic subset, Chinese-Jamaican. Her love of her family was matched only by her love of world. She'd set foot on every continent in her lifetime, took a Safari in her 60s and even found her way to an Amsterdam cafe in her 70s. Ms. Ling was described as the family's matriarch, often the patron saint of lodging, and its businesswoman whose business often seemed to be the family itself. She is survived by her grandson, Collin Hunt, 29, granddaughter Julian Hunt, 27, and several cousins, nieces, nephews, extended relatives and dear friends.

The federal International Trade Commission said this week that it would investigate the complaint, which was filed Dec. 1. The case is part of an escalating two-year legal battle between the two companies over inventions used in liquid-crystal display televisions. The Samsung patents relate to the way LCD screens portray the black and white portion of images. Samsung is seeking to block imports of Sharp Aquos HDTVs made in Mexico. Samsung, based in Suwon, South Korea, won an earlier trade commission order banning Sharp televisions from the United States. That case is on appeal. Sharp continues to import its televisions, saying it has altered the product to avoid using the Samsung invention. Samsung says Sharp is flouting the trade commission's order. A commission judge, Paul Luckern, said he would hear arguments on the dispute in April and release his findings by July 19.","Washington trade agency will investigate Samsung's latest patent-infrigement claims, which seek to block US imports of LCD Tvs made by Sharp Corporation; case is part of two-year legal battle between companies over inventions used in liquid-crystal display televisions (S)",2,[],The New York Times,[],U.S. To Investigate Trade Dispute Over LCD TVs,"[{""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO""}, {""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""SHARP CORP""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""TELEVISION SETS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""TELEVISION""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""SUITS AND LITIGATION""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAYS""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""INVENTIONS AND PATENTS""}]",2010-01-02T00:00:00Z,article,Business/Financial Desk,Technology; Business,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Bloomberg"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""NEWS""}], ""original""=>""By BLOOMBERG NEWS""}",News,4fd276c98eb7c8105d837e6b,178

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/movies/03kurosawa.html,"Of the 30 movies Kurosawa directed, better than half tell stories of present-day Japan, and a fair number of them, including “Stray Dog,” rank with his greatest works.","WHEN you think of Akira Kurosawa, you think, most likely, of swords and flags, of castles under siege, of men in dark armor and women in brilliant kimonos, of horses galloping to battle in driving rain. The movie that brought Kurosawa -- and Japanese cinema as a whole -- to the attention of the world, ''Rashomon'' (1950), was set in the distant past, and practically all the most celebrated films of the remaining 40-plus years of his career were historical dramas, too: ''The Seven Samurai'' (1954), ''Throne of Blood'' (1957), ''Yojimbo'' (1961), ''Sanjuro'' (1962) and ''Ran'' (1985). So it might seem a little strange that Film Forum's centennial Kurosawa retrospective should begin (on Wednesday) with a nine-day run of the 1949 urban noir ''Stray Dog,'' in which there isn't a horse or a castle in sight, and where the weapon of choice is a Colt pistol. It shouldn't. Of the 30 movies Kurosawa directed, better than half tell stories of present-day Japan, and a fair number of them, including ''Stray Dog,'' rank with his greatest works. ''Stray Dog,'' his ninth film, is a kind of police-procedural thriller, in which a young Tokyo homicide detective named Murakami (Toshiro Mifune) roams the crowded streets of the postwar city in search of his stolen gun. At first he merely feels humiliated, but before long much more painful emotions take hold. He learns, to his horror, that his gun is being used to commit robberies: one woman is seriously injured; the next dies. Murakami, crazed with grief and guilt, combs the seedier quarters of the sprawling city, where everybody looks hungry and desperate, wearied by an unrelenting summer heat. He trudges through this unwelcoming terrain with the grim persistence of a soldier making his way home after a lost campaign.",Terrence Rafferty article on films of Akira Kurosawa on occasion of Film Forum's centennial retrospective; photos (L),12,[],The New York Times,"[{""url""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/thumbStandard.jpg"", ""subtype""=>""thumbnail"", ""legacy""=>{""hasthumbnail""=>""Y"", ""thumbnailheight""=>75, ""thumbnail""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/thumbStandard.jpg""}, ""type""=>""image"", ""height""=>75}, {""width""=>395, ""url""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/sfSpan.jpg"", ""height""=>250, ""subtype""=>""xlarge"", ""legacy""=>{""xlargewidth""=>395, ""xlargeheight""=>250, ""xlarge""=>""images/2010/01/03/arts/03kurosawa_CA0/sfSpan.jpg"", ""hasxlarge""=>""Y""}, ""type""=>""image""}]",Kurosawa: Past and Present Tense,"[{""name""=>""persons"", ""value""=>""KUROSAWA, AKIRA""}, {""name""=>""glocations"", ""value""=>""JAPAN""}, {""name""=>""organizations"", ""value""=>""FILM FORUM""}, {""name""=>""subject"", ""value""=>""MOVIES""}]",2010-01-03T00:00:00Z,article,Arts and Leisure Desk,Movies; Arts,,"{""person""=>[{""organization""=>"""", ""role""=>""reported"", ""firstname""=>""Terrence"", ""rank""=>1, ""lastname""=>""RAFFERTY""}], ""original""=>""By TERRENCE RAFFERTY""}",News,4fd27d998eb7c8105d8456e7,1252

And while DVD sales declined by some $1 billion in 2009 from the previous year, sales of Blu-ray discs, according to data from the Digital Entertainment Group, rose by $200 million, partially offsetting the industry downturn.

When I finally got to America myself, I found that not only were the natives friendly and hospitable, they were also incredibly polite. No one tells you this about Americans, but once you notice it, it becomes one of their defining characteristics, especially when they're abroad. This is very strange, or at least it says something strange about the way that perception routinely conforms to the preconceptions it would appear to contradict.

Is this therapy or tabloid voyeurism?,"Last spring, at the Pasadena Recovery Center, while staff members were doing their morning rounds, three men sat behind the closed door of a dim in-patient bedroom. Members of a video production team, they were monitoring live feeds on glowing screens in a part of the Los Angeles drug-and-alcohol unit then serving as an ad-hoc command center for ''Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew'' -- a reality show on which celebrities who habitually alter their realities receive treatment for their addictions from a celebrity. On TV. Three mounted widescreens were broken into a dozen digital monitors, each showing a face from television past: Dennis Rodman, Heidi Fleiss, Mackenzie Phillips, Tom Sizemore and other less-celebrated substance abusers filled surveillance shots from around the building, the composite grid of video screens suggesting ''Hollywood Squares'' as directed by David Cronenberg. In one square, Sizemore, an actor known for playing hardboiled military men in such movies as ''Black Hawk Down'' and ''Saving Private Ryan,'' lay half conscious in his bed, detoxing from heroin, crystal meth, benzodiazepines and marijuana. He'd been in that state for two days, said Mark Perez, the show's supervising producer, which didn't seem to augur for great TV.

Universal had bought a script he'd written with his brother and frequent collaborator, Daniel -- an offbeat comedy called ''Welcome to Buzzsaw'' -- and as it inched towards production, the pair landed a gig on the 1990 action film ''Darkman,'' an early hit for the director Sam Raimi. In 1992 ''Welcome to Buzzsaw'' arrived in theaters, renamed ''Out on a Limb'' and starring Matthew Broderick. ''I was incredibly lucky,'' Josh Goldin said on a recent afternoon, sitting in a downtown Manhattan hotel lounge. And then, for the next 17 years, Mr. Goldin became a ghost. He worked on projects that either never came out or made it to theaters without his name on them. ''I wrote scripts that never went anywhere,'' he said, ''and I did rewrites for projects that looked like they might go somewhere and then didn't.''

Love, not architecture, is the focus of Boyle's novel about Frank Lloyd Wright. Boyle views his protagonist through the lens of his messy relationships with women and divides his story into sections corresponding to Wright's major romances. In the Book Review, Joanna Scott praised the novel as a ''powerful new chapter'' of Boyle's ''hilarious and terrifying fictional history of utopian longing in America,'' a ''mesmerizing story of women who invest everything, at great risk, in . . . Wright.'' THE MERCY PAPERS: A Memoir of Three Weeks, by Robin Romm. (Scribner, $13.)

Romm writes with ''fresh and uncompromising'' prose, ''fearless, scathing honesty'' and magnetic anger, Cohen said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/books/review/PaperRow-t.html,Paperback books of particular interest.,"THE WOMEN, by T. C. Boyle (Penguin, $16.) Love, not architecture, is the focus of Boyle's novel about Frank Lloyd Wright. Boyle views his protagonist through the lens of his messy relationships with women and divides his story into sections corresponding to Wright's major romances. In the Book Review, Joanna Scott praised the novel as a ''powerful new chapter'' of Boyle's ''hilarious and terrifying fictional history of utopian longing in America,'' a ''mesmerizing story of women who invest everything, at great risk, in . . . Wright.'' THE MERCY PAPERS: A Memoir of Three Weeks, by Robin Romm. (Scribner, $13.) This ''furious blaze of a book,'' as our reviewer, Leah Hager Cohen, described it, explores Romm's anguish over her 56-year-old mother's impending death from breast cancer. Romm writes with ''fresh and uncompromising'' prose, ''fearless, scathing honesty'' and magnetic anger, Cohen said. Death also shadows Diana Athill's SOMEWHERE TOWARDS THE END: A Memoir(Norton, $13.95), but she contemplates its approach from the perspective of a long life. A celebrated London editor, Athill, now 92, speaks gracefully and with good cheer about the losses and gains of old age.

One has inched ever closer to the required 75 percent approval from voters and is probably eagerly awaiting the announcement of the new class Wednesday. The other is close to being bumped off the ballot for too little support.

He was an eight-time Gold Glover with a golden arm to match. In his first year on the ballot, in 2002, he received 45.3 percent of the votes but he climbed to 67.3 percent last year. Dale Murphy, the longtime Atlanta Braves star, managed only 19.3 percent of the votes in his first year (1999) and declined to 11.5 percent in 2009. Murphy had 1,700 fewer plate appearances than Dawson because of injuries, but he hit 398 home runs, won Most Valuable Player awards in 1982 and 1983, and was awarded five Gold Gloves in center over 18 seasons. He is typically considered a ''close but no'' guy, his brief stretch of greatness from 1982 to '87 followed by a sharp decline.

The question re-emerged in Congress last month afterPresident Obama announced he would send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan, and it is likely to be a major issue as lawmakers return to work in January. Reaching back into the nation's history books, some lawmakers are suggesting a war bond program similar to those used during the Civil War and both World Wars. Such a program might reduce the country's reliance on foreign borrowing and avoid a tax increase.","Some economists fear that instituting war bonds program to help pay for Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as some legislators are calling for, could harm economy; suggest it would encourage people to set aside money instead of spending it, which could hamper recovery by taking money out of circulation; while many experts believe program could be morale booster, they also believe that tax increase is inevitable; photo (M)",2,[],The New York Times,[],Buying a Share of Victory.
